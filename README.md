# Company Local Area Network Design and Development
## This project aims to design and build a new local area network for a company that has recently undergone restructuring to meet their business requirements. The network is designed to cover several buildings, each with different departments.

## Physical Organization
    The physical organization of the network is as follows:

    _Building L: Hosts Sport and Health Departments
    _Building M: Hosts Sport and Health Departments
    _Building G: Hosts Business and Engineering Departments
    _Building A: Hosts Human Resources and Business Departments
    _Building K: Hosts main servers of all departments
## IP Address Planning
**IP address planning is a critical component of designing and building a local area network. The following IP address ranges will be used for each building:**
| Sport |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
Number of employee | 100
Each employee has | 01 PC + 01 IP Phone
The department has | 1 server
| Health |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
Number of employee | 50
Each employee has | 01 PC + 01 IP Phone
The department has | 1 server
| Business | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Number of employee | 50
|Each employee has | 01 PC + 01 IP Phone
|The department has | 1 server
|Engineering| | |
|Number of employee | 30|
|Each employee has | 01 PC + 01 IP Phone|
|The department has | 1 server|
|Human Resources| |
|Number of employee | 10|
|Each employee has | 01 PC + 01 IP Phone|
|The department has | 2 servers|

## Local Area Network Technologies
    Several local area network technologies will be implemented to ensure the smooth functioning of the network:

    Cisco Packet Tracer will be used to simulate the network and implement the configurations required for each building.
    Ethernet cables will be used to connect all devices within each building, ensuring a fast and reliable connection.
    Switches will be used to connect all devices within each building to each other and to the routers.
    Routers will be used to connect the different buildings to each other and to the internet.
## Implementation and Configuration
    A local area network of medium complexity will be implemented and configured for each building using Cisco Packet Tracer. The configurations will include:

_Configuring the routers to connect the buildings to each other and to the internet.
_Configuring the switches to connect all devices within each building to each other and to the routers.
_Assigning IP addresses to all devices within each building.
_Configuring the necessary routing protocols to ensure that all devices within the network can communicate with each other.
## Conclusion
    This project aims to design and build a local area network for a company that has recently undergone restructuring to meet their business requirements. The network will cover several buildings with different departments, and will be implemented and configured using several local area network technologies. This project will help the company to improve their network infrastructure, leading to better communication, collaboration, and productivity.
